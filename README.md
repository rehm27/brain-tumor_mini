This project adopts a dual-approach methodology to optimize the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection from MRI and CT scan images. The first approach involves using the Haar Cascade algorithm, which is pivotal for rapid tumor detection through feature-based cascading classifiers. This technique will preliminarily identify potential tumor regions quickly and with reasonable accuracy. The second approach integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to ascertain the presence of tumors in the images. Upon positive detection, the method employs OpenCV for image segmentation to meticulously outline and segment the tumor area. This two-pronged methodology ensures a comprehensive and precise analysis, leveraging both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance detection rates and diagnostic reliability. This structured approach facilitates a robust framework capable of handling varied imaging conditions and tumor characteristics, making the system versatile and scalable.

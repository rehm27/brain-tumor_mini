This project uses different imaging sources, our approach provides a more detailed and holistic view of medical conditions, 
helping doctors detect tumours more accurately and reduce diagnostic uncertainties. This advancement not only aids healthcare professionals in making more informed decisions 
but also paves the way for personalize treatment strategies.
By using deep learning our approach ensure that it is more is not only efficient but more insightful, 
ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and a significant step in the medical field.
Furthermore, the integration of these modalities enhances early tumour detection, reducing the chances of misdiagnosis and improving long-term in patient care. 
With continuous advancements in AI-driven healthcare, this study contributes to the evolution of precision medicine, 
ensuring more accuracy and time interventions for critical conditions.
